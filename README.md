# ALX Higher Level Programming

Welcome to my ALX higer level programming repository. This repository contains 
all projects that I am undertaking while learning higher-level programming.
Python is a powerful, high-level, and versatile programming language known 
for it's simplicity and readability. Python is used in web development, 
data analytics, machine learning, scientific computing and more.

## Getting Started

Python is an interpreted language, so you don't need to compile your code 
while running it. Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

	-print("Hello, World!")

To run this program, you can use the Python interpreter:

	-python hello.py

## Installation

Python is pre-installed on many operating systems, but you can download
the latest version from the official website using this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To check if Python is already installed, open your terminal and run:

	-python --version

## Repository Structure

Below is a list of directories of projects included:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](0x00-python-hello_world)
