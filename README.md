# ALX Higher Level Programming

Welcome to my ALX higer level programming repository. This repository contains 
all projects that I am undertaking while learning higher-level programming.
Python is a powerful, high-level, and versatile programming language known 
for it's simplicity and readability. Python is used in web development, 
data analytics, machine learning, scientific computing and more.

## Getting Started

Python is an interpreted language, so you don't need to compile your code 
while running it. Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

	-print("Hello, World!")

To run this program, you can use the Python interpreter:

	-python hello.py

## Installation

Python is pre-installed on many operating systems, but you can download
the latest version from the official website using this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To check if Python is already installed, open your terminal and run:

	-python --version

## Repository Structure

Below is a list of directories of projects included:

* [0X00.Python - Hello, World](0x00-python-hello_world)

## Acknowledgements

All work contained in this repository was completed as part of the software
engineering curriculum at ALX Africa. ALX Africa focuses on preparing students for
tech roles using projects based peer learning. For more information, visit
